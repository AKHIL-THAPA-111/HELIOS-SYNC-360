# PROJECT SMARTDOOR


### OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
This project is used to give an idea to make a automatic door.

### Key Features 
Fully Automated Door – Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect movement and opens/closes the door via a servo motor.

Precise Distance Sensing – The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor ensures accurate detection of objects within a specific range.

CH32V003F4U6 Microcontroller Powered – Runs on a 32-bit RISC-V core, offering fast processing and low power consumption.

Secure & Hands-Free – Eliminates the need for physical contact, making it hygienic and safe.

Adjustable Sensitivity & Delay – Users can fine-tune the detection distance and door closing delay for customized automation.

Compact & Low-Cost – Uses minimal hardware while delivering smart automation, making it ideal for DIY home automation projects.

Expandable & Upgradable – Can integrate with RFID, facial recognition, or IoT for enhanced security and smart home connectivity.

# Why This Matters 

Scalable and Cost-Effective
Scalable – Perfect for small to medium-sized solar installations, with the flexibility to expand as energy demands grow.
Low Maintenance
This design minimizes manual intervention, reducing the need for frequent adjustments and lowering long-term labor costs.
# How It Works
*  Sensors detect the distance
* Servo motors adjust their  position accprding to it
* Microcontroller processes feedback and ensures alignment
