### TERMINOLOGY :

#### Verilog netlist 

Verilog netlist represents the hardware description at a gate level,detailing how diffrent gates and flipflops are interconnected to form the processor.

#### Testbench

A testbench in verilog is used to simulate and verify the functionality of a design .i.e we try to simulate the hardware without using actual flipflops or logic gates.

### First we wil download some things needed for this :

#### At first we will use the command 

        sudo apt-get update

to update the latest packages from configured repositories . It basically prepares the system for package mangement tasks like installing or updating software.
